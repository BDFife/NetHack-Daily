# NetHackaDay

Backup for the NetHackaDay Website

## Things to do

xx Set up a folder for character runs

xx Set up a format for saved screenshots (turn by turn)

xx Set up a format for rogue-html marked-up screenshots (turn by turn)

xx Set up a format for savefiles (turn by turn)

xx Back up and record the .css extensions for the html

Switch to the \<pre\> tag instead of \<code\>

Consider dropping the HTML space characters

Update the CSS in the repository to match what is live on site

Make the hover blocks less translucent

Change the hover for inventory to float 'up' rather than down.

Determine why firefox browser behaves strangely when using hover (due
to interaction with the web host CSS and my local CSS)

## Things to remember

Save files are stored at /usr/games/lib/nethackdir/ on my computer. 
Have Fun!
