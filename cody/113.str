The fox, clearly dazed, staggered in front of Cody. He carefully replaced the camera in his bag, drew out a dart, and
flung it at point-blank range at the animal. The fox dropped to the floor, followed a moment later by a wheezing Cody.
"See how you like being poked full of sharp things!" he spat at the fox, then took a moment to gather his breath as he
sat in the doorframe. Cody nudged the fox, which lay, unmoving, considerably smaller than it had seemed a moment
before.
