A ring of free action will protect you from paralysis. You can
identify you are wearing a ring of free action by drinking a potion of
paralysis or melee attacking a monster with a paralyzing special attack. 

Unfortunately, if the ring you are wearing is not a ring of free
action, drinking a potion of paralysis or melee attacking a monster
with a paralyzing special attack both happen to be very popular ways to get yourself killed.
