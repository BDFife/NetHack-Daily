Feeling in front of him with his hands, Cody found what felt like a doorknob, revealed by what appeared to have been a
sliding wall. The knob didn't turn, but Cody had the bit in his teeth now. His hand dipped again into his bag, this
time pulling out his trusty gold card. Sliding it between the door and the door jamb, Cody worked the edge of the
card behind the door's bolt. A slight upward angle, a bit of force, and the card slid between bolt and jamb.
