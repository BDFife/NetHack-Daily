You can determine you are wearing a ring of slow digestion by
monitoring your hunger level while wearing it. The easiest way to
'test' for a ring of slow digestion is to wait until your character
changes hunger status (for example, loses satiation or becomes hungry)
and eat a tiny snack and see how long it takes for your hunger status
to change again. Generally a ring of digestion slows the hunger
process by a factor of twenty.
