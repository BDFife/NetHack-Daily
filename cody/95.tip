If you push a boulder into another boulder, common workarounds are to
either backtrack or destroy the boulder.

More aggressively, you can move onto a space containing a boulder if
you drop almost all of your gear. Giants can also stand in squares
with boulders, which could work for your if you have a way to polymorph into a
giant.
