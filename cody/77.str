Drawing close to the passageway, Cody could not yet see anything but the unrelieved black of the unlit corridor. If
anything, this passageway was even darker than the other two. Clearly these passageways were not meant for guests, but
Cody felt an odd reluctance to go back to the first room and try the door. "I'm sure this passageway will lead back in
that direction. I'll just swing through here and come out in the dining area from this side," said Cody, his curiosity
about this place undiminished.
