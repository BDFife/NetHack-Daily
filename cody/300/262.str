Without thought, Cody's hand dove into his bag, into the quiver of darts inside the bag, and withdrew a single dart. He
completed the motion with an underhanded fling at the adjacent kobold zombie. All in all, it was a smoothly executed maneuver, and
one Cody would have been quite proud of had the dart actually hit the creature. Fortunately, it was enough to distract the
zombie, which paid for its momentary inattention as Lulu seized its ankle in her jaws. Worrying it with fury, she succeeded
within the course of a few seconds of tearing the entire limb off the admittedly decrepit zombie. With that, it collapsed
and did not move again.
