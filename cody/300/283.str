Cody reached out for the door, found the handle, and cautiously tried
it. The handle moved easily, and the door swung open soundlessly. Cody
gripped his pole sickle, but from his current vantage, the room
appeared empty. In a far corner, another closed door led to the left,
and on the same wall there was a second opening, this one with no door
at all. Lulu danced to the side for a look herself, but did not try to
push past Cody.
