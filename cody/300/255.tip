Some spells, like Fireball, have a ranged area of effect  associated
with them. These spells may sometimes be cast on a specific location
away from your character, rather than just a in a direction,  like a
ray or beam spell typically allows requires. These ranged spells will
still follow a path to the target location, and may detonate early if
they hit something on the way.
