As the lichen began to move towards him, Cody dodged away from the
creature. Lulu, however, had other ideas. Entering the room on Cody's
heels, she immediately rushed at the lichen, a ferocious blur of teeth
and fur. The lichen halted, but was far too slow to prevent the little
dog from plunging her teeth repeatedly into the base of several of the
tendrils. After only a moment of this, the lichen shuddered and fell
over, motionless except for the pieces of creature being worried by
the triumphant Lulu.
