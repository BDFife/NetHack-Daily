Behind him, Cody could hear the growl of an increasingly frantic Lulu. Thinking quickly, he took a hand off the pole sickle
and slid it into his bag, pulling out his camera. He aimed in the general direction of the jackal and pressed the shutter.

its confusion could not overcome its basic instinct for biting anything within reach. Cody gritted his teeth and shook the
canine free from his other leg.
