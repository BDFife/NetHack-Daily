“This place needs a name,” Cody decided suddenly. He continued to creep forward as he considered the possibilities. “The
Place? Too generic. Not-Restaurant? Doesn't exactly flow off the tongue. The Cave of Snarling Jackals? It has a nice ring
to it, but I'm not sure it's really a cave, and what if I run into a dragon? It would be silly to name a place with a
dragon after the jackals skittering about on the upper floors.” He thought for a moment. “Although if I do run into a
dragon, I suspect the name of the place will be far from my mind.”
