sickle out in front of him with one hand, the other hand lingering in his bag near his darts. He supposed he ought to
try to use the pole sickle more, but he did not have the same comfort with the polearm that he did with the darts. He
would have preferred a chance to practice with it before putting it to use in actual combat. "Plenty of darts left,"
he said to himself. "How big can this place be, anyway?"
