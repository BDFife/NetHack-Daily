A ring of sustain ability is useful when you want to avoid having your
stats change, and generally a bad idea the rest of the time, since it
also prevents you from gaining intrinsics or improving your stats. One
of the easiest ways to identify you are wearing a ring of sustain
ability is to eat a poisoned corpse (without poison resistance) and
notice whether or not you lose strength.
