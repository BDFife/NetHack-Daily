Placing his hands near the top of the box and, just in case, standing slightly to the side, Cody gingerly lifted the
lid. Peeking inside, he saw a common edible fungus and, of much more interest, an elaborately decorated tome. He
eagerly reached in and took both out. The book sparkled in the light, and he admired it for a moment before placing
both item in his bag. As he took his hands out, however, he noticed that they, too, now sparkled where they had touched
the book. Cody sighed, and thought dark thoughts about wizards who take their decorating advice from twelve-year-old
girls.
