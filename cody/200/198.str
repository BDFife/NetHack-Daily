After briefly trying to wipe his hands off on the stone of the wall, an effort that met with little success, Cody moved
near the entrance of the first passageway. For a change, although the passageway itself was as dark as the others had
been, he could see in the distance a room -- and, beyond that, another room. "More and more options," said Cody, a tad
uneasily. More options meant more opportunities to be ambushed, flanked, surrounded. At that moment, he heard a noise
behind him, and he whirled, heart pounding. It was only Lulu, though, jumping into the large box and sniffing its
corners with great purpose.
