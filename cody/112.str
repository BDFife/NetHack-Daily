"I am not," Cody grunted, "going to die," kicking forcefully and dislodging the fox, "underground," reaching into his
bag, "in a room," fingers alighting on a small glass bottle, "with a fox." He pulled out the bottle, smashing the top
against the doorframe and tossing the contents back in a single gulp. The wound in his leg closed immediately, and he
straightened, drawing in a deep breath. "Now that is more like it." Cody looked down, feeling much better, and
discovered the fox with his teeth now wrapped around Cody's shin.
